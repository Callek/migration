# The overall plan for Windows is this:
#
# Tests are easy and basically already done.  The tricky bit is Talos, since it
# is tied to hardware.
#
# * Using try or date, green up talos for (existing) opt and debug TC builds via BBB
# * Switch the TC builds and BB-via-BBB tests to tier 1; this starts the
#   6-12 week beta clock
# * Deploy a taskcluster worker to a small portion of linux buildslaves
# * Using try or date, green up talos using those taskcluster workers
# * Deploy to the remainder of the buildslaves, converting suite by suite
#   to manage teh load across teh split pool of hardware, until 100% TC
#
# This moves all Windows build platforms together, all Windows test platforms together,
# That is, we will not get Win10 to the finish line and then go back to start over with
# Win7.  Similarly, opt and debug builds will be handled simultaneously.
#
# Except Windows XP.  XP Can't run in the cloud, and we will not try to run it
# via Generic-Worker,  Instead, it will run via BBB until the platform is no longer
# supported (Firefox 53, for reals this time)
